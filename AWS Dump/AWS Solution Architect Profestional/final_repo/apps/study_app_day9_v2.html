Confirmation includes the recipient‚Äôs signature or a photo of the package with the recipient. The driver‚Äôs handheld device uploads signatures and photos through FTP to a single Amazon EC2 instance. Each handheld device saves a file in a directory based on the signed-in user, and the file name matches the delivery number. The EC2 instance then adds metadata to the file after querying a central database to pull delivery information. The file is then placed in Amazon S3 for archiving.As the company expands, drivers report that the system is rejecting connections. The FTP server is having problems because of dropped connections and memory issues in response to these problems, a system engineer schedules a cron task to reboot the EC2 instance every 30 minutes. The billing team reports that files are not always in the archive and that the central system is not always updated.A solutions architect needs to design a solution that maximizes scalability to ensure that the archive always receives the files and that systems are always updated. The handheld devices cannot be modified, so the company cannot deploy a new application.Which solution will meet these requirements?",
