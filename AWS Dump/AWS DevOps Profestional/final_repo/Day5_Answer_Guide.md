**C√¢u h·ªèi**: A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. When the application starts up. the application needs to process data from an Amazon S3 bucket before the application can start to serve requests. The size of the data that is stored in the S3 bucket is growing. When the Auto Scaling group adds new instances, the application now takes several minutes to download and process the data before the application can serve requests. The company must reduce the time that elapses before new EC2 instances are ready to serve requests. Which solution is the MOST cost-effective way to reduce the application startup time?

**C√°c l·ª±a ch·ªçn**:

**Lo·∫°i**: Single Choice

**C√¢u h·ªèi**: A company is using Amazon S3 buckets to store important documents. The company discovers that some S3 buckets are not encrypted. Currently, the company's IAM users can create new S3 buckets without encryption. The company is implementing a new requirement that all S3 buckets must be encrypted. A DevOps engineer must implement a solution to ensure that server-side encryption is enabled on all existing S3 buckets and all new S3 buckets. The encryption must be enabled on new S3 buckets as soon as the S3 buckets are created. The default encryption type must be 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256). Which solution will meet these requirements?

**C√°c l·ª±a ch·ªçn**:

A. Create an AWS Lambda function that is invoked periodically by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule. Program the Lambda function to scan all current S3 buckets for encryption status and to set AES-256 as the default encryption for any S3 bucket that does not have an encryption configuration. ‚ùå

B. Set up and activate the s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled AWS Config managed rule. Configure the rule to use the AWS-EnableS3BucketEncryption AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook as the remediation action. Manually run the re-evaluation process to ensure that existing S3 buckets are compliant. ‚úÖ

C. Create an AWS Lambda function that is invoked by an Amazon EventBridge event rule. Define the rule with an event pattern that matches the creation of new S3 buckets. Program the Lambda function to parse the EventBridge event, check the configuration of the S3 buckets from the event, and set AES-256 as the default encryption. ‚ùå

D. Configure an IAM policy that denies the s3:CreateBucket action if the s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption condition key has a value that is not AES-256. Create an IAM group for all the company's IAM users. Associate the IAM policy with the IAM group. ‚ùå

**ƒê√°p √°n ƒë√∫ng**: B

**Gi·∫£i th√≠ch**: 
AWS Config managed rule v·ªõi Systems Manager Automation provides comprehensive solution cho both existing v√† new buckets. Automatic remediation ensures compliance.

## C√¢u 78

**Lo·∫°i**: Single Choice

**C√¢u h·ªèi**: A company is hosting a static website from an Amazon S3 bucket. The website is available to customers at example.com. The company uses an Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy with a TTL of 1 day. The company has decided to replace the existing static website with a dynamic web application. The dynamic web application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. On the day of production launch to customers, the company creates an additional Route 53 weighted DNS record entry that points to the ALB with a weight of 255 and a TTL of 1 hour. Two days later, a DevOps engineer notices that the previous static website is displayed sometimes when customers navigate to example.com. How can the DevOps engineer ensure that the company serves only dynamic content for example.com?

**C√°c l·ª±a ch·ªçn**:

A. Delete all objects, including previous versions, from the S3 bucket that contains the static website content. ‚ùå

B. Update the weighted DNS record entry that points to the S3 bucket. Apply a weight of 0. Specify the domain reset option to propagate changes immediately. ‚ùå

C. Configure webpage redirect requests on the S3 bucket with a hostname that redirects to the ALB. ‚ùå

D. Remove the weighted DNS record entry that points to the S3 bucket from the example.com hosted zone. Wait for DNS propagation to become complete. ‚úÖ

**ƒê√°p √°n ƒë√∫ng**: D

**Gi·∫£i th√≠ch**: 
DNS caching v·ªõi TTL 1 day means some clients still resolve to S3. Removing S3 DNS record completely ensures all traffic goes to ALB after DNS propagation.
