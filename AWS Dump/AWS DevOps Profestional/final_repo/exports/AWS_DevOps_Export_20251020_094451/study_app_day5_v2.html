As part of the update process, the company exports the JavaScript SDK for the API from the API Gateway console and uploads the SDK to an Amazon S3 bucket.The company has configured an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses the S3 bucket as an origin. Web clients then download the SDK by using the CloudFront distribution’s endpoint. A DevOps engineer needs to implement a solution to make the new SDK available automatically during new API deployments.Which solution will meet these requirements?",
