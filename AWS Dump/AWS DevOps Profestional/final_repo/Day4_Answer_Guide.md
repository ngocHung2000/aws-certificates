**Lo·∫°i**: Single Choice

**C√¢u h·ªèi**: A company has deployed an application in a production VPC in a single AWS account. The application is popular and is experiencing heavy usage. The company's security team wants to add additional security, such as AWS WAF, to the application deployment. However, the application's product manager is concerned about cost and does not want to approve the change unless the security team can prove that additional security is necessary. The security team believes that some of the application's demand might come from users that have IP addresses that are on a deny list. The security team provides the deny list to a DevOps engineer. If any of the IP addresses on the deny list access the application, the security team wants to receive automated notification in near real time so that the security team can document that the application needs additional security. The DevOps engineer creates a VPC flow log for the production VPC. Which set of additional steps should the DevOps engineer take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

**C√°c l·ª±a ch·ªçn**:

A. Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure the VPC flow log to capture accepted traffic and to send the data to the log group. Create an Amazon CloudWatch metric filter for IP addresses on the deny list. Create a CloudWatch alarm with the metric filter as input. Set the period to 5 minutes and the datapoints to alarm to 1. Use an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to send alarm notices to the security team. ‚úÖ

B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket for log files. Configure the VPC flow log to capture all traffic and to send the data to the S3 bucket. Configure Amazon Athena to return all log files in the S3 bucket for IP addresses on the deny list. Configure Amazon QuickSight to accept data from Athena and to publish the data as a dashboard that the security team can access. Create a threshold alert of 1 for successful access. Configure the alert to automatically notify the security team as frequently as possible when the alert threshold is met. ‚ùå

C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket for log files. Configure the VPC flow log to capture accepted traffic and to send the data to the S3 bucket. Configure an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster and domain for the log files. Create an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the logs from the S3 bucket, format the logs, and load the logs into the OpenSearch Service cluster. Schedule the Lambda function to run every 5 minutes. Configure an alert and condition in OpenSearch Service to send alerts to the security team through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when access from the IP addresses on the deny list is detected. ‚ùå

D. Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold query results. Configure the VPC flow log to capture all traffic and to send the data to the log group. Deploy an Amazon Athena CloudWatch connector in AWS Lambda. Connect the connector to the log group. Configure Athena to periodically query for all accepted traffic from the IP addresses on the deny list and to store the results in the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to automatically notify the security team through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when new objects are added to the S3 bucket. ‚ùå

**Lo·∫°i**: Single Choice

**C√¢u h·ªèi**: A development team uses AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeBuild to develop and deploy an application. Changes to the code are submitted by pull requests. The development team reviews and merges the pull requests, and then the pipeline builds and tests the application. Over time, the number of pull requests has increased. The pipeline is frequently blocked because of failing tests. To prevent this blockage, the development team wants to run the unit and integration tests on each pull request before it is merged. Which solution will meet these requirements?

**C√°c l·ª±a ch·ªçn**:

A. Create a CodeBuild project to run the unit and integration tests. Create a CodeCommit approval rule template. Configure the template to require the successful invocation of the CodeBuild project. Attach the approval rule to the project's CodeCommit repository. ‚ùå

B. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to match pullRequestCreated events from CodeCommit Create a CodeBuild project to run the unit and integration tests. Configure the CodeBuild project as a target of the EventBridge rule that includes a custom event payload with the CodeCommit repository and branch information from the event. ‚úÖ

C. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to match pullRequestCreated events from CodeCommit. Modify the existing CodePipeline pipeline to not run the deploy steps if the build is started from a pull request. Configure the EventBridge rule to run the pipeline with a custom payload that contains the CodeCommit repository and branch information from the event. ‚ùå

D. Create a CodeBuild project to run the unit and integration tests. Create a CodeCommit notification rule that matches when a pull request is created or updated. Configure the notification rule to invoke the CodeBuild project. ‚ùå

## C√¢u 70

**Lo·∫°i**: Single Choice

**C√¢u h·ªèi**: A company has an application that runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The application requires frequent restarts. The application logs contain error messages when a restart is required. The application logs are published to a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An Amazon CloudWatch alarm notifies an application engineer through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the logs contain a large number of restart-related error messages. The application engineer manually restarts the application on the instances after the application engineer receives a notification from the SNS topic. A DevOps engineer needs to implement a solution to automate the application restart on the instances without restarting the instances. Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient manner?

**C√°c l·ª±a ch·ªçn**:

A. Configure an AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook that runs a script to restart the application on the instances. Configure the SNS topic to invoke the runbook. ‚ùå

B. Create an AWS Lambda function that restarts the application on the instances. Configure the Lambda function as an event destination of the SNS topic. ‚ùå

C. Configure an AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook that runs a script to restart the application on the instances. Create an AWS Lambda function to invoke the runbook. Configure the Lambda function as an event destination of the SNS topic. ‚ùå

D. Configure an AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook that runs a script to restart the application on the instances. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts when the CloudWatch alarm enters ALARM state. Specify the runbook as a target of the rule. ‚úÖ

**ƒê√°p √°n ƒë√∫ng**: D

**Gi·∫£i th√≠ch**: 
EventBridge rule directly trigger Systems Manager Automation runbook khi alarm state changes. Eliminates need for SNS topic v√† Lambda function, most operationally efficient.
