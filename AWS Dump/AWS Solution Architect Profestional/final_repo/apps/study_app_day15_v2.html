To ensure a good experience for players during the launch period, the company deployed a static quantity of 12 r6g.16xlarge (memory optimized) Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer. The company's operations team used the Amazon CloudWatch agent and a custom metric to include memory utilization in its monitoring strategy.Analysis of the CloudWatch metrics from the launch period showed consumption at about one quarter of the CPU and memory that the company expected. Initial demand for the game has subsided and has become more variable. The company decides to use an Auto Scaling group that monitors the CPU and memory consumption to dynamically scale the instance fleet.
